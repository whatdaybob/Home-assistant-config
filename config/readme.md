So I use my own dashboard mainly as all devices are available in it but recently I added the [lovelace-dwains-theme](https://github.com/dwainscheeren/lovelace-dwains-theme) to my configuration to simplify the mobile app experience.

Majority of my setup is in [packages](./packages) to make it easier to string things together.

My [configuration.yaml](./configuration.yaml) doesn't contain much as I split it out to folders in the [configuration](./configuration) and [integrations](./integrations) folder depending on what they are.

All frontend made by me is located in [lovelace](./lovelace) and my [lovelace-dwains-theme](https://github.com/dwainscheeren/lovelace-dwains-theme) is in the [dwains-theme](./dwains-theme) folder.
