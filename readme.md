# Home Assistant Configuration by [@whatdaybob](https://github.com/whatdaybob) 


[Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) configuration files.

This is my personal Home Assistant Configuration. I tinker here and there and hopefully am doing it correctly!

I will try and write a description for each folder as I add to it!

I have Home Assistant running on an [Intel NUC DN2820FYKH (Similar Model as mine is discontinued)](https://amzn.to/3cJvEMg)
